# Flutter Todo App

A simple and intuitive To-Do List application built with Flutter. This app allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It’s a great project for learning how to build a mobile app with Flutter and integrating state management, local storage, and a responsive UI.

## Features
- **Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks**: Manage your to-do list easily.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Keep track of your progress.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are saved locally, so you don’t lose your to-do list when you close the app.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed to work on both phones and tablets.

## Tech Stack
- **Flutter**: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Dart**: The programming language used to develop the app.
- **SQLite** or **SharedPreferences**: For storing tasks locally on the device.
- **Provider** or **Riverpod**: For state management (if implemented).
